class ALP(NNDataDescriptor):
    """
    Implementation of the Average Localised Proximity (ALP) data descriptor [1]_.
    Expresses the proximity of a query instance to the target data,
    by localising its nearest neighbour distances against the local nearest neighbour distances in the target data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int or (int -> int) = 5.5 * log n
        How many nearest neighbour distances / localised proximities to consider.
        Corresponds to the scale at which proximity is evaluated.
        Should be either a positive integer not larger than the target class size,
        or a function that takes the size of the target class and returns such an integer.

    l : int or (int -> int) = 6 * log n
        How many nearest neighbours to use for determining the local ith nearest neighbour distance, for each `i <= k`.
        Lower values correspond to more localisation.
        Should be either a positive integer not larger than the target class size,
        or a function that takes the size of the target class and returns such an integer.

    scale_weights : OWAOperator = additive()
        Weights to use for calculating the soft maximum of localised proximities.
        Determines to which extent scales with high localised proximity are emphasised.

    localisation_weights : OWAOperator = additive()
        Weights to use for calculating the local ith nearest neighbour distance, for each `i <= k`.
        Determines to which extent nearer neighbours dominate.

    max_array_size : int = 2**26
        Maximum array size to use. For a query set of size `q`,
        calculating local distances requires an array of size `[q, l, k]`,
        which can be too large to fit in memory. If the size of this array is larger than `max_array_size`,
        a query set is batch-processed, which is slower.
        TODO: determine maximum array size dynamically, investigate lowering float precision

    preprocessors : iterable = (IQRNormaliser(), )
        Preprocessors to apply. The default interquartile range normaliser rescales all features
        to ensure that they all have the same interquartile range.

    Notes
    -----
    `k` and `l` are the two principal hyperparameters that can be tuned to increase performance.
    Its default values are based on the empirical evaluation in [1]_.
