class VectorSizeNormaliser(Unsupervised, FeaturePreprocessor):
    """
    Rescales each instance (seen as a vector) to size 1.
    Typically used on datasets of frequency counts,
    when only the relative frequencies are considered important,
    e.g. token counts of texts in NLP.

    Parameters
    ----------
    measure: str or float or (np.array -> float) = 'boscovich'
        The vector size measure to use.
        A float is interpreted as Minkowski size with the corresponding value for `p`.
        For convenience, a number of popular measures can be referred to by name.

    Notes
    -----
    If the size of an instance is 0, it will be left unscaled.
    If the size of an instance is âˆž, it will be scaled to 0.
